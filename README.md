# Can CNNs trained on globally discriminative patterns exploit absolute position

My control dataset aims to provide a means of determining whether CNNs would exploit absolute position when trained on global discriminative patterns, as opposed to local patterns.

I provide:
- A training set with positional bias
- A similar test set
- A dissimilar test set

The global discriminative patterns to distinguish between are varying frequency sinusoidal waves going either horizontally (class A), or vertically (class B).

(To be continued)
